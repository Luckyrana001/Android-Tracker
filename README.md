Thanks<br/>
The main idea behind this application development is information , that we all know that information is of how much importance in this digital world.</p></br>
So i have tried to develop a application which can track as well as provide a secure way to store day by day activities.
There is also a few more reasons to develop this application because in this fast paced life everyone is worried about their family members and always try to know that what they are doing , where are they .
So this application can provide a way to help them.
This application has single user accessibility all the time, The email-id and password which is used in the registration will be treated as user login page credential in this app.
After login into application user can check following information form his local database: 

1. Facebook,whats app and other chatting apps notification messages
2. User phone messages (inbox/outbox/sent box)
3. User call records (miss call/ dialed /received call)
4. Browser history
5. User location Gps information ( this is updating by itself and storing the information into the database as we get a new notification message. )
if user of this application would like these information on his registered email -id then user can setup a alarm in the settings which will fire a email on the user selected time.
These are few other key feature of this application:
1. If you want other people to restrict from un-installing this app, you can just set this app un-installable in the setting page and no one can uninstall this application without device administration use.
2. There is feature "Anonymous login" , it will redirect user to search nearby place on maps without letting him know that what this application doing in the background.
